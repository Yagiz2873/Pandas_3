# Pandas_3
This file includes my homework's solutions from the course
This is a general exercise file about what we've learnt in Pandas so far. I've told you what I've learnt at previous files so I would like to mention different parts for this file. With the help of .set_option(); we can set the value of the specified option. Also we can get different dataset such as titanic,tips,Iris etc. To get unique values for columns, I've used Counter() method from  collections but I could've achieved this easily by using nunique() :) .We can use .astype() method and its derivatives to change columns' types.

We can use .drop() method to remove some columns or row from dataset. We should add 'inplace=True' expression to affect main dataset from this change. Also I've created some new functions and use them with conditions and loops altogether.

That's all for now :) . I couldn't add my Excel files because of the privacy of data and you can see all the dataset in Excel. I will be adding my project files as well as my other files about unsupervised and supervised learning but I could mention about all of these (Excel,ML and project) at job interview too :)
